**Getting Started**

This guide will walk you through setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows using Azure Pipelines and/or GitHub Actions. The provided project structure includes various workflow files for different scenarios, demonstrating best practices for implementing CI/CD pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/products/devops/) organization for Azure Pipelines.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository for GitHub Actions.

> **Note:** Pipelines are configured to deploy to Azure services, so you need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/free-services/)

## Project Structure

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ azure-multistage.yml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ azure-docker.yml

â”œâ”€â”€ gitHub-Actions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ azure-app-services.yml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ azure-app-services-docker.yml
```

The project is organized into two directories: `azure-Pipelines` and `gitHub-Actions`. Each directory contains workflow files for different CI/CD scenarios.

## Instructions

### **Azure Pipelines**

1. [**Basic Azure Pipeline:**](azure-Pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml)

   This pipeline demonstrates a basic CI/CD process using Azure Pipelines.

2. [**Multi-Stage Pipeline:**](azure-Pipelines/azure-multistage.yml)

   This pipeline demonstrates a multi-stage CI/CD process where different stages, such as build, test, and deploy, are defined.

3. [**Docker Pipeline:**](azure-Pipelines/azure-docker.yml)

   This pipeline showcases CI/CD for Docker applications, including building and pushing Docker images.

4. [**Kubernetes Deployment:**](azure-Pipelines/azure-kubernetes.yml)

   This pipeline shows how to deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster.

### **GitHub Actions**

1. [**Azure App Services Deployment:**](gitHub-Actions/azure-app-service.yml)

   This workflow demonstrates deploying an application to Azure App Services using GitHub Actions.

2. [**Azure App Services with Docker:**](gitHub-Actions/azure-app-service-docker.yml)

   This workflow illustrates deploying a Dockerized application to Azure App Services.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Azure Pipelines**:

   - Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps.
   - Copy the content of the desired `.yml` files from the `azure-Pipelines` directory and paste it into the pipeline configuration.
   - Configure the pipeline settings, triggers, and variables as needed.
   - Save and run the pipeline.

2. **GitHub Actions**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Create a new workflow file by navigating to the `.github/workflows` directory and create a new `.yml` file.
   - Copy the content of the desired `.yml` files from the `gitHub-Actions` directory and paste it into the workflow file.
   - Commit the changes to your repository.
   - GitHub Actions will automatically detect and run the workflow based on triggers defined in the workflow file.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've successfully set up CI/CD workflows using Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. These workflows will help you automate the build, test, and deployment processes of your applications, ensuring faster and more consistent delivery. Feel free to explore and customize the workflow files to match your project's specific requirements.

For more advanced usage, refer to the official documentation for both Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Happy coding and automating! ðŸš€
